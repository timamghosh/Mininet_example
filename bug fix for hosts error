Basically...
For error in exporting python script
line 2019 needs to be changed in miniedit.py

instead of for widget, item in self.widgetToItem: it should be for widget, item in self.widgetToItem.items(): because items() must be called on dict and it is correct everwhere else other than this line.
For error in saving as .mn file
remove self.convertJsonUnicode call in line 1444 of mininet.py

instead of loadedTopology = self.convertJsonUnicode(json.load(f)) just use loadedTopology = json.load(f). The loadedTopology dict keys are loaded as bytes when using convertJsonUnicode which should actually be strings.
